Achieved accuracy of 95%. I developed an advanced deepfake image detection system that addresses the rising challenge of manipulated images in digital media. As deepfakes become increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between genuine and altered content is essential for maintaining trust and authenticity online. My project utilizes cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, focusing on deep learning techniques to analyze and classify images effectively. The system is trained on a diverse dataset comprising both authentic and deepfake images, enabling it to learn the intricate patterns and anomalies that characterize manipulated visuals. The model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which excels at feature extraction and image classification tasks. By analyzing pixel patterns, color distributions, and textural details, the system can detect subtle inconsistencies that might go unnoticed by the human eye. Additionally, I incorporated techniques such as data augmentation to enhance the modelâ€™s robustness and performance.
